                Did you hear some people speak about the 5am club and are you wondering what
                it is all about and whether it is even worth getting up at this insane 5am?
              </p>
              <p><b>The 5am Club. Own your Morning. Elevate your Life.</b></p>
              <p>
                Robin Sharma has been preaching to get up at 5am for decades already. One of
                his latest books and programs is called "The 5am Club. Own your Morning.
                Elevate your Life." He claims that it can help you become more successful and
                live a fuller and happier life. Thousands of people have adopted this practice
                of getting up at 5am. A simple Facebook search reveals that there are many
                groups of tens of thousands of people who practice the 5am club. Getting up
                early is one thing, but Robin Sharma's book provides us with routines that
                will help you make the most of starting your day at 5am. The most important
                routine is the 20-20-20 practice.

              <p>
                When you wake up at 5am you divide the first hour of your day in three pockets
                of twenty minutes. The first twenty minutes you will do some sports. The next
                twenty minutes are spent meditating or journaling and the last twenty minutes
                are used to learn new skills.

              <p>
                The first twenty minutes of your day, you will have to move. Robin Sharma
                advises to do some cardio exercises, like running or rowing. The point is to
                get your heart rate up and sweat a little bit. The benefits of working out are
                a better health, you remain younger, improved mental capabilities and you will
                produce more hormones that'll make you feel good during the day. What better
                way to start your day than improving your health and stamina? I usually work
                out on a cross trainer and watch tutorials or other informative stuff. In this
                way I not only learn during the last pocket of twenty minutes, but also in
                this pocket I'll have twenty minutes of formation.

              <p><b>The second Pocket: Journaling or Meditation</b></p>
              <p>
                The second pocket of twenty minutes is used to improve your mindset and gain
                clarity. What do you journal on? Robin Sharma advises to include gratitude in
                your daily practice and write down ten things for which you are grateful. I
                agree with the importance of practicing conscious gratitude, but I prefer
                doing so in the evening as it will help me close my day and sleep better. He
                further advises to set 5 small acts of greatness. These acts are the things
                that will help you to reach your big five life goals. In the journal here
                below you can see that there are twenty-five prompts of "I am". Write down
                twenty-five traits of how you want to show up in the world and lead your life.
                These affirmations will help you become the man or the woman you envision. And
                then you can journal on things that are occupying your mind to get clarity and
                hopefully find a way to move forward or deal with difficult situations. I
                often also use this space to summarize what I have learnt in the third pocket
                the day before. Journaling in this way helps you to take control of your mind
                and your day.<br /><br />

              <p>
                The last twenty minutes of your victory hour you spend studying to get ahead
                in your field. Successful people are lifelong learners. It helps you to stay
                ahead, stay focused and keep an open mind. It is a lovely feeling to decide at
                the beginning of the year what you want to learn and then actually learn those
                things. When looking back at the end of the year, realizing how much I have
                learned, I feel a deep sense of gratitude.

              <p><b>Conclusion:</b></p>
              <p>
                Following the routines of the 5am club allow you to start your day feeling
                healthy, powerful and happy. Are you ready to give it a try? You will not only
                improve your life but also join a wonderful community of change makers.
